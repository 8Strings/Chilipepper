Chilipepper
===========

This repository hosts projects related to Chilipepper FMC radio board. The board can be found here
http://www.toyon.com/chilipepper.php along with supporting guides and demonstration files.

Philosophy
----------

Generally, this repository is meant to provide two major components. The first is a set of tutorials on how to using Mathworks HDL Coder, specifically via MATLAB to HDL code generation, along with Xilinx tools. These include the Xilinx Embedded Development Kit (EDK) and Xilinx System Generator. These laboratory exercises can be found in the "Labs" directory.

These laboratory exercises eventually lead up to the second component, which is a QPSK ad hoc modem example. This is found in the QPSK_Radio directory. 

As Chilipepper is meant more as a learning tool than a true product we encourage other open source projects. Please contact embedded@toyon.com if you are interested in contributing.

Support
-------

The Chilipepper User's Guide and firmware for the microcontroller can be found in the ChilipepperSupport directory.
