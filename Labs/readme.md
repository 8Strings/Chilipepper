The goal of these laboratory exercises is to demonstrate a flow that uses Mathworks HDL Coder with MATLAB to HDL code generation, Xilinx tools, and the Toyon Chilipepper board. The exercises should be run in progression and include:

A "Lab_0" to introduce the user to the flow by Blinking LEDs on the ZED board

The remaining labs include:
1. Output a tone
2. Receive a tone
3. Output a QPSK pattern
4. Achieve carrier lock on a QPSK pattern
5. Determine timing offset on a QPSK pattern
6. Receive and decode a transmitted pattern
7. Interface a processor with transmitter in order to output a message
8. Receive packet
